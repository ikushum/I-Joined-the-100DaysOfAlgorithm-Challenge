To join the Challenge read [Lets Join the #100DaysOfAlgorithm](https://ishansubedi.herokuapp.com/blog/7) and get started.


## FAQ:

#### Who can join the Challenge ?
Anyone who are passionate about coding and can dedicate at least one hour a day for the challenge for next 100 days.

#### What language should we use to code ?
Its completely up to you. Just choose the language which you think is good for you.

#### Is there a specific set of Algorithm Problems for the Challenge ?
No. You can work on any set of Challenges you want. If you are not sure how to start check out [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/warmup) or [CodeWars]( https://www.codewars.com)

#### What if we have to skip a day for some reason ?
If you have to skip a day for some reason then when you resume, the day that you skipped will not be counted as one of your 100 days

#### How many algorithms can we solve per day ? 
There's no rush. We have an entire 100 days on our hands so one or two algorithms a day is completly fine.
